  	The number of arguments supplied to a script.	
 2.$0

 3.$n

	These variables correspond to the arguments with which a script was invoked. Here n is a positive 	decimal number corresponding to the position of an argument (the first argument is $1, the second 	argument is $2, and so on).

 4.	Any arguments appear as "$1", "$2", "$3" and so on
 5.-eq 	
	Checks if the value of two operands are equal or not; if yes, then the condition becomes true. 		[ $a -eq $b ] is not true when a=10 & b=20.
